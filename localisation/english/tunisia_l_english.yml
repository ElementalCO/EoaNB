  POLITICS_MUHAMMAD_III_AL_SADIQ: "Muhammad III, the Righteous, is the Twelfth Bey of Tunisia. He was 'Bey al-Mahalla' from the 10th of June 1855 to the 23rd of September  1859. The same day he was heir apparent, he was appointed Divisional General in the Imperial Ottoman Army. After the death of his brother, Muhammad II ibn al Husayn, Muhammad III took over as Bey as his nephew was too young at the time to rule, although he did end up adopting him. There are rumours about the British consul trying to persuade him to set up the first official printing press ..."

  tunisia.5.t: "Invite Northern Reformists"

Their commanding admiral says they are here to help the Bey against any person who prevents him from granting freedom to his subjects and to assure them of the peace and security of their persons and their property. Meanwhile, we got news of a new message from the British Consul Richard Wood, who added that a British squadron anchored in Malta is awaiting his word if tensions flare between the Bey and admiral or if any threats by the fleet are formulated against the town."
  tunisia.9.a: "We should have expected this ..."

  tunisia.10.t: "Naval Bombing of Tunis"
