 BRA_platine_hegemony: "Brazilian Platine Hegemony" 
 BRA_male_revolt_reparation: "Malês Reparations"
 BRA_imperial_army: "Exército Imperial Brasileiro"
 BRA_imperial_army_desc: "The Army of the Empire of Brazil is one of the most formidable land forces in the American continent. It was first organized in the War of Independence in September 1822, mainly by old Luso-Brazilian troops which stayed in the mainland and joined the cause of Dom Pedro I. It emerged victorious from the skirmishes against the Portuguese troops and by 1824 the war was over. Since then, the army went through many conflicts, including the Cisplatina War and, most recently, the Platine War. Following the end of the Platine War, the army's state started to decay, the number of troops decreased, and the lack of equipment and modernization became clear. If we expect to emerge victorious in future conflicts and secure our interests, the army needs to be modernized, rearmed and become the strongest in South America!"
 BRA_imperial_navy: "Armada Imperial Brasileira"
 BRA_imperial_navy_desc: "The Brazilian Armada is among the strongest fleets in the entire globe. Born in the struggle of Independence in 1822, the navy quickly assembled itself in order to protect the mainland from further Portuguese aggression. With the war concluded in 1825, the navy would be of key importance in securing the Empire's interests in the Platine Basin, being of key importance in the wars fought in the region. The navy needs to grow larger and stronger to maintain the status quo achieved in the Platine War, and to protect the lands of the Empire from outside aggression. However, the Empire currently does not sustain the capabilities to produce ships, forcing us to acquire new vessels from foreigners, such as the British and the French. If we want to make sure Brazil rules the waves, we must allocate new funds, and modernize and expand our fleet!"

 dynmod_BRA_New_World_Immigrants: "O Novo Mundo"
 dynmod_BRA_New_World_Immigrants_desc: "As a nation in the New World, the population of Brazil is formed by immigration from other countries. Starting with the Portuguese, many ethnicities have found and will still find their way to our shores. This comes with its benefits; the immigrants bring with them knowledge and tradition, which can improve our country's culture. Economic growth is due to the increase in the size of the population and the settlement of the interior. Immigration, however, decreased after the approval of the 'Land Law', which forced new settlers to buy the lands from the government instead of settling them for free. If the Empire desires to become an industrial power, it needs to keep encouraging immigration to the country and facilitate and expand it in any way possible."
 dynmod_BRA_Agriculture_Money: "Brazilian Agriculture"
 dynmod_BRA_Agriculture_Money_desc: "The largest sector of the Brazilian economy is agriculture. One of the main reasons for Portuguese colonization is that the climatic variation found across the country allows for a multitude of potential economic activities. Be it coffee, tobacco, or sugarcane, there is an interest in its cultivation. However, this demonstrates that the economy of the Empire is, in its majority, still agrarian.\nMoney from Brazilian Agriculture: \n Livestock: [?BRA_Livestock_Country_Money] \n Coffee: [?BRA_Coffee_Country_Money]\n Sugar: [?BRA_Sugar_Country_Money] \n Tobacco: [?BRA_Tobacco_Country_Money] \n Cocoa: [?BRA_Livestock_Country_Money] \n Tea: [?BRA_Tea_Country_Money]"
